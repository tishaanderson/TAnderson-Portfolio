        <p id="unt-paragraph">I know nothing...I mean, NOTHING!!... about coding. In 2013, I graduated from the University of North Texas with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Behavior Analysis. Unfortunately, I never had an opportunity to use my degree. Instead, I worked the next 6 years bartending at various restaurants. It was pretty kush, however, nearing my 30s, I realized having steady health insurance might be nice.</p>

        <p id="work-paragraph">In February of 2020, I started working in a custom print shop just in-time for the covid shut downs to begin. I had health insurance immediately with my new job. I kept bartending on the weekends until the restraunts shut down. I got SO lucky!!! I made my change EXACTLY when I needed.</p>

        <p id="middle-paragraph">THANK YOU, UNIVERSE!!</p>

        <p id="dog-paragraph">While working there, I met my best friend and love of my life. A few months after that, I got my first fur-baby, Smokey (aka Smokey Bear). <img id="smokey-pic" src="./assets/images/smokey-pic.jpg" alt="full body image of gray and white pitbull looking directly at camera"> A year later, I bought my first [tiny] house, on an acre, in the middle of nowhere, texas.<img id="yard-pic" src="./assets/images/backyard-pic.jpg" alt="green country landscape with sunset and donkeys in the background"> We had to quickly fill that space with two sweet girls- Wendy and Moody.</p>

        <img id="girls-pic" src="./assets/images/girls-pic.jpg" alt="dalmation pup and golden malinois-X dog lying next to each other with smiles and tongues hanging out looking at camera">

        <p id="life-paragraph">I absolutely LOVE where I am in life right now. The only thing missing is the ability to be home more. I want the freedom to work wherever I'd like and, of course, have the financial freedom that can come with it. So, here I am! I believe coding can be that solution for me. It just makes sense. My hopes are this can be the cherry on top for reaching my dreams in life.</p>

        <p>With all that said-- don't judge too hard!</p>
